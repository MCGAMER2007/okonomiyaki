First, take the cutting board and knife and start to chop the cabbage
</p1>
</p1>
Next, crack four eggs, put them into the bowl with the flour, and mix.
</p1>
</p1>
After you add in the chopped cabbages and some water. Then start mixing once again.
</p1>
</p1>
Once you are done with the mixture split it into two separate bowls. Then put the two separate fillings in the separate bowls. 
</p1>
</p1>
Next, chop up the shrimp, bacon, and squid.
</p1>
</p1>
Mix the bacon or seafood well and prepare the frying pan to start making your dish.
</p1>
</p1>
Than start spraying the oil for the mixture
</p1>
</p1>
Next, pour the mixture on to the pan and start to pat it out into a circle.
</p1>
</p1>
Once it seems to start browning in the corners flip it over.

Top the okonomiyaki with the mayonnaise, okonomiyaki sauce, and katsuobushi. Once the entire thing is done, it will end up like this. Now the last step is to enjoy.
